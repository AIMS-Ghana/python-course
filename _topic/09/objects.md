## Numbers *vs*. ?

Many of us learn mathematics as a sort of [physics of bottlecaps](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/main.html):
that the rules are about numbers, and that anything we figure out from maths
could ultimately be turned into a physical observation process,
such as counting bottle caps, or measuring lengths, masses, *etc*.

This perspective is useful, as it is implicitly reminds
us how to practice science via mathematical story-telling.

However, mathematics is also about
describing classes of things with certain shared features and operations, and
then being able to reason about the behaviors of those things without
reference to material things.

## Objects

You have worked with several types in Python so far:

{% include relblock.md target="sometypes.py" %}

Integers and floating point numbers and character strings are probably familiar,
at least what the are, if perhaps not as a programming concept.

But what are those things associated with `turtle` plotting?  They are custom objects.

Now let's revisit the homework, creating objects for the shapes and using them in previous.

## Review

The rest of the course periods are an open-topic review, question and answer sessions to support getting your project work done.
