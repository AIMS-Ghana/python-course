In the file `fun_plots.py`, you will find several functions.

Implement your own plotting function in `calculus_plotter.py` that plots a function, it's derivative, and it's integral on the same graph.  Use different colors or line types to distinguish the curves and include a legend.

Finally, edit `make_fun_plots.py` to use your plotting function to make plots for each of the functions in `fun_plots.py`.
