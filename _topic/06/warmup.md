[Set](http://www.setgame.com/sites/default/files/instructions/SET%20INSTRUCTIONS%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf) is a game between two players.  There are cards featuring symbols with various properties (4 properties, each with the 3 possible values) in a deck which contains all possible combinations of features.  Initially, 12 cards are drawn randomly from the deck and revealed on the board.

The players try to be the first to identify sets of three cards on the board
where, for each feature on the cards, either all of the cards agree (*e.g.*, all
of the symbols are the same color) or all of the cards disagree (*e.g.*, the
symbols are diamonds on one card, pills on another, and squiggles on the last).

When a player identifies a set, that player removes those cards from the board and gets a point.  Three cards are drawn from the deck to replace them.  If no sets are present, then cards are added to the board three at a time until a set is present.

When the deck runs out of cards, and no more sets are on the board, the player with the most points wins.
