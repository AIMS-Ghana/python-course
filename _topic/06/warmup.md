[Bananagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananagrams) is a word game.

There is a large pool of unrevealed letters, and each player initially draws 15.

They then try to form words, as if they were playing on their own Scrabble board.  However, they can reform the words any time they like.

Once a players uses their pile of tilestr, they declare 'Peel', and all players draw another tile.  Any player may declare 'Dump' and return any tile to the unrevealed pile and draw two new tiles.

When the unrevealed pile has fewer letters than players, the next player to use all their tiles may declare 'Bananas'.  If their words are all correct, they win.  If not, they lose, their tiles are returned to the unrevealed pile, and play resumes.
