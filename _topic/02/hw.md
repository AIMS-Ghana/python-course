Write program `draw_shape.py`, which defines a function that receives the shape type and area, and draw the corresponding shape.  This script should `import shapes` to use the functions you defined earlier.

When you have finished that, the file `render_shapes.py` (already implemented, no need to fiddle with it) should now work as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
python-course-homework username$ ./render_shapes.py
... draws a series of shapes ...
{% endhighlight %}

The `render_shapes.py` file imports those other files, so you will need to examine it to know what function names to use.

Next, the file `render_curves.py` identifies several functions for you to implement, and once you do, it will produce a plot of those curves.  Update the `curves.py` file with the relevant definitions.

As you work through this homework, you should consider committing your incremental progress.
