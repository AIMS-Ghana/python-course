Write program `draw_shape.py`, which defines a function that receives the shape type and area, and draw the corresponding shape.  This script should `import shapes` to use the functions you defined earlier in class.  You will also need to import some modules for shape drawing - ask a friend or the internet for advice about which ones and examples of how to use them.

When you have finished that, the file `render_shapes.py` (already implemented, no need to fiddle with it) should now work as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
{{ site.hwprompt }} ./render_shapes.py
... draws a series of shapes ...
{% endhighlight %}

The `render_shapes.py` file imports those other files, so you will need to examine it to know what function names to use.
