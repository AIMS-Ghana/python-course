The game Connect 4 has two players alternating turns dropping their tokens (differentiated by color)
into a series of 7 columns, each of which is 6 rows high.  When placed, the tokens fill the lowest open row in a column.  A player wins when placing a token causes there to be 4 in a row of a particular color.

Write down the parts for a program of this game.  Recall yesterday's warmup if you want hints
about what needs including.
