The game [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) (Noughts and Crosses, Xs and Os) has two players alternating turns marking
their symbol on a 3x3 board, with winner being the player making the 3rd mark in a row.

Since this is the very first warmup, I will give you some hints about what to consider for your paper program:

 - what should players see?
 - what are player inputs?  do they have to be checked?
 - how does what players see change?
 - how can the end of the game be determined?

When you do the warmups, you should NOT be writing Python code.  Write English directions,
but they need to be succinct and specific enough for a person that has never played
the game to be able to "run" your program.  You will be trading your pseudo-program
with a classmate for critical evaluation.
