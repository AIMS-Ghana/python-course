The game Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses, Xs and Os) has two players alternating turns marking
their symbol on a 3x3 board, with one winning once they get 3 in a row.

Since this is the very first warmup, I will give you some hints about what to consider for your paper program:

 - what should players see?
 - what are player inputs?  do they have to be checked?
 - how does what players see change?
 - how can the end of the game be determined?

When you do the warmups, you should NOT be writing Python code.  Write English directions,
but they need to be succinct and specific enough for a person that has never played
the game to be able to "run" your program.
