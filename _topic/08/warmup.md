[Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) is a dice and word game.

There is a box with a 4x4 grid and transparent top, and 16 dice with letters on each face.  The Boggle box is shaken to mix the faces and positions of the dice.

The players then have 3 minutes to identify words made from the letters shown.  Words are made by chains of adjacent (including diagonal) letters.  Paths to make words may cross, but letters may not be re-used.

The players record their words, and at the end of the 3 minutes, they are scored.
Words found by multiple players are removed from their lists.  The remaining words are awarded points according to length (3-4: 1 point, 5:2, 6:3, 7:5, 8+:11).
