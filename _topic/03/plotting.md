## Drawing vs. Plotting

There are two main tasks in visualization, which I will refer to as drawing and plotting.

In plotting, the scale and exact line positions are precise: ideally, you can determine exact numbers by reading off the lines with reference to the scales.  You can use the `numpy` plotting library by importing `pylab`.

In drawing, the scale and lines are aesthetic rather than precise.  It's still important to get them "right",
but right is subjective - the goal with drawing is to illustrate, rather than exact representation.  Python has a basic library for drawing called `turtle`.
