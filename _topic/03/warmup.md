The game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) is a single player game on a 4x4 board.
Tiles of value 2 or 4 randomly appear on the board.  The player shifts the tiles on the board
in any of the 4 directions, and tiles of the same value merge when shifted towards each other.

The player wins if they create a 2048 tile.
