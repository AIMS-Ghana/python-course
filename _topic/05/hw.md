1. numpy array calcs
2. numpy array Functions
3. plotting Functions
4. integration w/ trapezoid method
5. integration w/ scipy tools

Next, the file `render_curves.py` identifies several functions for you to implement, and once you do, it will produce a plot of those curves.  Update the `curves.py` file with the relevant definitions.

As you work through this homework, you should consider committing your incremental progress.
