## Mathematical Variables, Parameters, Functions, Equations, *etc*

**DISCUSSION: WHAT CONCEPTS DO THESE IDEAS REPRESENT IN MATHEMATICS?**

## Translating that into Compu-speak

blah-blah-blah

important syntax note: indentation in Python

## Task: Implement Geometric Formulae

Example:

{% include pyblock.md target='square_geom.py' %}

Your assignment:

 - pick at least 10 other shapes with well defined formulae for geometric properties
 - implement those formulae as functions and verify the results for dimensions
 that you can check with pen and paper
 - bonus: who can implement the most formulae?

## PREP FOR NEXT SESSION

 - [Nose testing intro](http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/nose-intro.html)
 - [testing in PyCharm](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/Creating+and+running+a+Python+unit+test);
 warning: written assuming using unittest, so there are extra details that will
 not be relevant to testing with `nose`
