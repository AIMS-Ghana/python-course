## Introductions

## Getting Accounts Sorted

1. Account at the lab machine
2. [Github](https://github.com) - get an account, register ssh key
3. optional: [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com),
   [Python Forum](http://www.python-forum.org/), etc.

## Machine Setup

1. [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (should be installed)
2. Configure PyCharm
3. optional for personal machines: [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/)

## Course Overview

We have several goals for the Python course:

 - for *you* to be able to accomplish basic scientific computing tasks in Python
 - for *others* to be able to understand what you accomplished
 - for *you* and *others* to be able to have confidence in your results
 - for *you* to be able to teach yourself how to have those for less simple tasks

The first item entails a basic understand of how to direct the computer to do work
via Python.

The second corresponds to doing that in a code-literate (programate? algorate?) way.

The third assumes the second, but also includes that your code has a development
history and testing results.

The final item, however, means that this class may feel very unfamiliar.  We
will typically start with a short discussion of a concept.  I will then pose
many problems related to that concept.  *You* will have to grapple with that
concept and figure out how to solve the problems.  I will answer questions, but
I will always ask you a few questions of my own:

 - What have you tried?  What was the result of that?
 - What documentation or WWW resource did you consult?
 - Which of your classmates have you talked to about the issue?

If I get the same question more than once, I will refer the questioner to their
classmates that know the answer.

I know that many students are accustomed to getting a step-by-step recipe, and
then getting feedback on applying that recipe.  In this class, you will be expected
to find the recipe as well.  Once you are outside these walls, whether you want
to continue in research or seek employment in industry or start your own business,
you will be expected to solve problems.  None of the instructors can solve those
problems for you.

Throughout the course we will we have a number of small assignments for you to
use to acclimatize to programming and to Python.  In the final week, you will
build a numerical simulation of a differential equation model, and use that
model to answer some questions about that system.
