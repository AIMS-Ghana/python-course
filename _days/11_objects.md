## Numbers *vs*. ?

Many of us learn mathematics as a sort of [physics of bottle caps](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/main.html):
that the rules are about numbers, and that anything we figure out from maths could
ultimately be turned into a physical observation process, such as counting bottle
caps, or measuring lengths, masses, *etc*.

I am quite fond of this view of mathematics, as it is corresponds quite readily
to what we do in the practice of science via mathematical story-telling.

I am equally fond, however, of the notion of mathematics as being about
describing classes of things with certain shared features and operations, and
then being able to reason about the behaviors of those things.
