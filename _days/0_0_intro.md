## Course Overview

Our goal for the Python course is two-fold:

 - for *you* to be able to accomplish basic scientific computing tasks
 - for *you* to be able to teach yourself how to accomplish less simple tasks

We will also be practicing good development habits.

This means that you will be getting lots of practice, lots of feedback, but you
will also be expected to figure out how to do many tasks with limited guidance
from me.
