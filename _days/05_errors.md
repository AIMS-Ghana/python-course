## What are Errors?

Certainly, some of you have gotten less-than-perfect grades on work you have done
leading up to this.

What caused you to get less than perfect scores?  I suspect that it was some combination of:

 - you did everything \"right\", but had incomplete knowledge or logic
 - you had incorrect knowledge or logic
 - you ran out time trying to complete the work
