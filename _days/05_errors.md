## What are Errors?

Certainly, some of you have gotten less-than-perfect grades on work you have done
leading up to this.

What caused you to get less than perfect scores?  I suspect that it was some combination of:

 - you did everything \"right\", but had incomplete knowledge or logic
 - you had incorrect knowledge or logic
 - you ran out time trying to complete the work

Can errors be useful?

**DISCUSS: WHEN HAVE YOU FOUND ERRORS USEFUL?  WHAT MADE THOSE ERRORS USEFUL, DISTINCT
FROM THE ONES THAT WERE NOT?**

## Errors in Programs

Exceptions

how are exceptions produced, how are exceptions handled, why exceptions instead of something else?

## Task: Have invalid arguments produce exceptions

## PREP FOR NEXT SESSION
