title: "Flow Control III: `while`"

## Recall: Numerical Root Finding Methods

## Searching Iteration with `while`

## Task: Implement the Secant Method

Basic requirement: provide a method that receives

 - a function,
 - two initial guesses for zeroes,
 - and a desired tolerance

and using those, applies the Secant method.

The twist points:
 - provide an alternative implementation that can use the derivative, which is of
course the Newton-Rhapson Method.
 - have the program determine which approach to use based on the input to the same
 function

## PREP FOR NEXT SESSION

 - review object-oriented programming
