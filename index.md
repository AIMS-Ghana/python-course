## Overview

Site for the AIMS-Ghana course *Introduction to Scientific Programming with Python*

## Course Description

The course covers (1) programming for (2) scientific applications with
(3) Python.  The course assumes limited programming background, but familiarity
with general maths concepts (*e.g.*, calculus, probability, and geometry) and
basic numerical mathematics (*e.g.*, finite difference methods).

The course will focus on the main tasks in scientific computation:

 - reading / writing data
 - transformation / subsetting of data
 - bulk analysis of data
 - approximation and simulation of systems
 - visualization

To support accomplishing these feats, the course will introduce students to a
variety of programming constructs:

 - variables, constants, and functions
 - input and output devices
 - flow control with branching (`if`-`else`) and iteration (`for`, `while`)
 - collections
 - functional programming (comprehensions, iterators, generators)
 - objects
 - reuse / libraries / packages

and several development tools and practices that are especially important to
scientific reproducibility:

 - version control / data management
 - unit testing
 - literate programming
