title: Notes on `numpy`
---

The `numpy` module provides a complete system for working with series of numbers,
particularly objects in linear algebra like matrices and vectors, but also more
generally.  The [tutorial](http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial) is
fairly complete.

We are going to start by revisiting our numerical equation work.

Now we will look at some Project Euler problems, specifically [6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)
and [11](https://projecteuler.net/problem=11).
