## Python Scripts, Running, Writing in an IDE - Pycharm

When you need to be able to think about more than a few lines at a time, you
should be writing a script.  Moreover, when you need to perform some task several
times, you should be writing a script.  Since this is one of the main reasons to
use a computer (repeating identical tasks), we will primarily work in this mode.

We will start with the task that you should always perform when you are first
trying to learn a new language: create and run a program that will produce the
phrase `hello world` on an appropriate output device.

Start the PyCharm application.  There will be some initial use questions.  If
you want to have your screen look like mine, you should choose the `darcula`
theme.

We will make a few other changes in the settings, specifically in
[appearance](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/webhelp/editor-appearance.html) and
[testing](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/webhelp/python-integrated-tools.html).

You should create a project named `intro-python`; we will do our course work in
this directory.

Now create a new Python file (either via hotkeys ctrl-N, or by right clicking
the project and selecting \"new\...\", or by using the dropdown menus) named
`hw` (the `.py` extension will be added automatically).

## Practice

**WRITE CODE THAT CAUSES THE STRING `HELLO WORLD` TO APPEAR WHEN YOU RUN THE
SCRIPT**

**NEXT LAUNCH THE CODE FROM THE TERMINAL COMMAND PROMPT**

These two tasks are fundamentals you will repeat throughout the course:
creating a script and verifying that it works by running it.
