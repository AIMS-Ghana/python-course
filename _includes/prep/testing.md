Next session we cover a concept called unit testing. See what you can learn via
Google about unit testing, then specifically:

 - read about `nose` (*e.g.*, [Nose testing intro](http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/nose-intro.html))
 - read about integrated unit [testing in PyCharm](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/Creating+and+running+a+Python+unit+test);
 warning: written assuming using `unittest` module, so there are extra details that will
 not be relevant to testing with `nose`
 - read about using [doctest](http://pymotw.com/2/doctest/)
