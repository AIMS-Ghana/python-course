Next session will cover variables and functions in Python.

 - review what these mean in mathematics or maths-related disciplines other than
 programming
 - learn how to declare variables and functions in Python (hint: use Google, or
   consult a classmate, or a textbook)
 - you can test your knowledge by tweaking your `hw.py` to use variables and functions
