Most of the programming work you do should be accomplished during the sessions,
though there may be some left over or you may to want to make additional
improvements.

However, I will typically provide some reading material, and you should expect
to discuss ideas from that material at the beginning of the next session.

For the next session, the preparatory reading is:

 - review some programming intros: *e.g.*, [this](http://codingintro.com/),
 [that](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs/programming/intro-to-programming/v/programming-intro),
 or [another](http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Programming)
 - complete [github tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
